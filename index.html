          <h3>Real-time Helmet Detector</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a CNN model for detecting whether riders wearing helmets
            or not. The model was then integrated into a Raspberry Pi, camera,
            and speaker. The integration enabled real-time monitoring of helmet
            usage, with the camera capturing visual data, the ML model analyzing
            it, and the speaker providing immediate feedback based on the
            detection results.
